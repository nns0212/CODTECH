Duration:May to June 2024
Mentor:G.SRAVANI


OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
Using Linear Regression for predicting Housing Prices based on the dataset.

ABOUT LINEAR REGRESSION :
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear 
relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features. When the 
number of the independent feature, is 1 then it is known as Univariate Linear regression, and in 
the case of more than one feature, it is known as multivariate linear regression. 
Why Linear Regression is Important? 
The interpretability of linear regression is a notable strength. The modelâ€™s equation provides clear 
coefficients that elucidate the impact of each independent variable on the dependent variable, 
facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. Its simplicity is a virtue, as linear 
regression is transparent, easy to implement, and serves as a foundational concept for more 
complex algorithms. 
Linear regression is not merely a predictive tool; it forms the basis for various advanced models. 
Techniques like regularization and support vector machines draw inspiration from linear 
regression, expanding its utility. Additionally, linear regression is a cornerstone in assumption 
testing, enabling researchers to validate key assumptions about the data.

KEY ASPECTS:
i)  Data Collection
ii) Data Preprocessing
iii) Split the data
iv) Train the Linear Regression Model
v) Make Predictions
vi) Evaluate the model
vii) Visualize the output
