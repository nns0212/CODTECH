Duration:May to June 2024
Mentor:G.SRAVANI


OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
Develop a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions. Use techniques like anomaly detection or supervised
learning with imbalanced data.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
i)Data Collection

ii) Handling Imbalanced Data

iii) Model Training

iv)  Model Evaluation

v) Deployment

vi) Monitoring and Maintenance

OBJECTIVE:
The model used must be simple and fast enough to detect the anomaly and classify it as a fraudulent transaction as quickly as possible.
Imbalance can be dealt with by properly using some methods which we will talk about in the next paragraph
For protecting the privacy of the user the dimensionality of the data can be reduced.
A more trustworthy source must be taken which double-check the data, at least for training the model.
We can make the model simple and interpretable so that when the scammer adapts to it with just some tweaks we can have a new model up and running to deploy.
